# GPA Calculator v2

This software is a CLI-based tool used to calculate the GPA score for FPT
University students using their transcript Excel file downloaded from FAP
(FPT University Academic Portal) website.

## 1. How to install the tool:

### a. Prerequisites:
First of all, a Python environment is required, so please **install Python
first** (Python 3 is recommended). Next, as there are several dependencies
for the tool, it is recommended to run the tool in a **virtual environment**.
You can refer how to create a virtual environment
[here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-python-virtual-environment-windows-linux/).

### b. Step 1: Clone this repo:
You can use this command to clone this repo to your machine:

`git clone https://github.com/NTHieu2k1/gpa-calculator-2.0.git`

### c. Step 2: Switch the current directory to the repo's directory:
You can use this command:

`cd gpa-calculator-2.0`

### d. Step 3: Install dependencies:
This is the **MOST IMPORTANT** step, as the tool cannot run properly
without those dependencies installed. If you have created a virtual environment,
just activate the environment before installing. After that, as the dependencies
are defined in `requirements.txt` file, you can just use this command to
install required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### e. Step 4: Run the tool:
To run the tool, just type this command:

`python run.py`

## 2. How to pre-process the transcript Excel file:
After downloading a transcript Excel file from FAP website, it is **CRUCIAL**
to pre-process the file before putting into the tool, because the original
file cannot be properly read (due to incorrect format) and may lead to errors
in calculation.

To pre-process the original transcript file, please following the steps:

- **Step 1**: Open the file in Excel. When you see the notification below,
click "Yes".

- **Step 2**: Click *Save* or press Ctrl+S. When a notification occurs like
below, click "No". A *Save As* window will appear, just save a new file.

## 3. How to calculate the GPA score:
When you open the tool, please follow the instructions below to calculate
your GPA score:

- **Step 1**: Specify the path of your pre-processed file (if you have not
done yet, please follow the [Section 2](#2-how-to-pre-process-the-transcript-excel-file)
above).
- **Step 2**: You can choose either *Overall* or *One semester* mode for
calculation. If you choose *One semester* mode, make sure that you specify
the semester's name (i.e. Fall 2022).
- **Step 3**: Review the exemption subjects. These subjects would not be
used in the calculation process. You can add or remove subjects to the
list (if do so, just specify the first 3 letters of the subject code).

Now the tool will calculate the GPA score for you, based on your selection,
and display the final score.
